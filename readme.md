### Colors

The project uses a custom gold and silver color palette defined in `tailwind.config.js`. You can modify these colors to match your brand:

```javascript
colors: {
  gold: {
    500: "#FFC300", // Main gold color
    // other shades...
  },
  silver: {
    500: "#ADB5BD", // Main silver color
    // other shades...
  },
  midnight: {
    900: "#00050F", // Deep background color
    // other shades...
  }
}
```

### Content

To update the content of the landing page, edit the `animated-landing.tsx` file:

- Update the `features` array to change the game features
- Modify the `testimonials` array to update reviews
- Change images by replacing the placeholder URLs


### Adding Pages

This is a single-page landing site. To add more pages:

1. Create new files in the `app` directory following Next.js App Router conventions
2. Add navigation links in the header component
